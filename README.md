# CadPad
Small 3x3 Macropad for Cadding


I designed this because I noticed that while using my small 36 key split keyboard it was very difficult to quickly do keyboard shortcuts. I decided to make a macropad for common shortcuts in OnShape, as thats what I use regularly for personal projects and also for projects on my robotics team. One of the main challenges for this was routing the PCB. This is one of my first PCB projects and making sure that all of the connections were made to the correct places was tedius. It has 9 keys for some of the most common functions, extrude, new sketch, fillet, etc, and a rotary encoder for zooming in and out. These are all features that are difficult to do on my split, so hopefully this macropad helps with that.

Assembly

Assembly uses m3 socket head screws (I already have plenty) and m3 heatset inserts. The pcb sits in the case and the plate is sandwiched down with the screws. 

BOM:

9x MX Switches
9x Diodes
9x Keycaps
1x Oled Screen
1x Rotary Encoder
1x XIAO RP2040
4x M3 Bolts
4x M3 Heatset Inserts
~100g PLA
